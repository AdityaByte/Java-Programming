Locks in Java - 
There are two types of locks in Java
1. Intrinsic
2. Explicit

1. Intrinsic : These are built into every object in java.
    you don't see them, but they are there. When you use a synchronized keyword,
    you're using these automatic locks.

2. Explicit : These are more advanced locks you can control yourself using the Lock class
    from java.util.concurrent.locks. you explicitly say when to lock and unlock,
    giving you more control over how and when people can write in the notebook (Notebook as an example.)

Advantages of using the manual locking technique or explicit locks over synchronized way :
1. fairness - fairness means it will maintain the order of FIFO and it checks out all the threads are being processed 
without ignoring any of the one.
2. Indefinately blocking is not happened in it since it happens in the Synchronized way.
3. Interruptibility can be happened in the manual locking technique since it doesn't happen in the synchronized way cause
it is the automatic way.
4. Read/write locking is possible in manual locking in synchronized way it doesn't know about which document is read or which 
one is write.
