// StringBuffer - A thread safe mutable sequence of character, it is also like a string but can be modified
// It can be used in a multithreaded program cause it is thread safe.
/*
Note: Both String and StringBuffer objects are thread safe.
StringBuffer is synchronized, making it thread-safe, but this does not mean that multiple threads can access it
simultaneously without potential performance issues.
Immutable objects are by default thread-safe because their state can not be modified once created.
Since String is immutable in Java, itâ€™s inherently thread safe.

        word.insert(0, "Hey there ");
        System.out.println(word); // Prints - Hey there Aditya Pawar Loves coding.

        // 3. Delete - Delete a sequence of characters from a particular index to at a index
        word.delete(0, 10);
        System.out.println(word); // Prints - Aditya Pawar Loves coding.

        // 4. Reverse - It reverse the orders of character in a buffer.
        word.reverse();
        System.out.println(word); // Prints - gnidoc sevoL rawaP aytidA

        // 5. Replace - For replacing a string from start index to end index.
        StringBuffer newWord = new StringBuffer("Hey there");
        newWord.replace(1, 3, "oi"); // it includes the start index but exclude the end index.
